## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/terminal-banking-system.git
cd terminal-banking-system
```

### 2. Install required packages

Ensure you have MySQL running and install the required Python package:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

### 3. Create MySQL Database

Login to your MySQL server and create a database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE vip;
```

You do **not** need to create tables manually—the script will do that on first run.

### 4. Update MySQL credentials

In the Python file (`bank.py` or main script), update the following credentials with your MySQL config:

```python
self.db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_mysql_user",
    password="your_mysql_password",
    database="vip",
    auth_plugin="mysql_native_password",
)
```

### 5. Run the app

```bash
python bank.py
```

## 🔐 Admin Login

Use the following credentials for admin access:

* **Username:** `vicky`
* **PIN:** `456`
